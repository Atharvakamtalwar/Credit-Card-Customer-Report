# Data Flow

The data for this project is stored in a database server, following industry best practices. The workflow is as follows:

### Database Setup: 
Initially, a database was created with the appropriate schema to store the credit card customer data.
### Data Ingestion: 
The raw data from Excel files was then copied into the database tables, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
### Power BI Integration: 
The Power BI Desktop application was connected to the database server, allowing it to directly fetch and analyze the data.

This setup ensures that when new data is added to the database, the Power BI report will automatically reflect the changes, providing up-to-date insights without manual intervention.
